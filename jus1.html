            <div class="about">
                Code Enigma is a 24-hour hackathon where students from various colleges/ Universities compete with one another by finding solutions to issues that affect real-world society. By developing projects that are inspired by their hobbies, students are pushed to expand on what they already know. The best method to learn what you enjoy and discover new interests are to work on projects outside of the classroom. You have 24 hours to come up with something new and show us what you've got in an infinitely possible universe!
